# Alcohol-Consumption

The main goal of this project was to find what factors were the best predictors of alcohol consumption in students. To find this, we did different forms of data analysis on our dataset. The four different data analyses we did were: Clustering, Memory Based Reasoning, Neural Networks, and Decision Trees.

We gained most of our insight from clustering and decision trees. Both models showed sex to be a highly influential factor. Final grade was also a factor we found to be useful in both. From clustering specifically, we also saw that parent education and health were related to alcohol consumption. In our decision trees we found that for predicting alcohol consumption, the strength of family relationships was more important for females that go out while final grade was more important for the males.

Overall, the results of our analysis wasn't very surprising given their alignments with common knowlegde relating to alcohol consumption predictors.
